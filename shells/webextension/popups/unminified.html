  <b>This page is using an unminified build of React. &#x1f6a7;</b>
</p>
<p>
  The React build on this page appears to be unminified.
</p>
<p>
  This makes its size larger, and causes React to run slower.
</p>
<p>
  Make sure to <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/optimizing-performance.html#use-the-production-build">set up minification</a> before deployment.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
  Open the developer tools, and the React tab will appear to the right.
